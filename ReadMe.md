A template project for an OpenTK application to perform
per-pixel rendering, using the new OpenTK version 4.x.x,
which requires a different approach compared to previous
OpenTK versions.

You should change the template names for your own project!

This template could be useful for applications such as
ray tracing.

This template has been iterated on through multiple of my projects,
but its first version had been adapted from a template by
Peter Vangorp for the Utrecht University CS Bachelor course "Graphics (INFOGR)" (2021-2022)
